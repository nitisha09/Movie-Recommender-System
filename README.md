# Movie-Recommendation
In this project , I have made a Movie Recommendation System using pandas library in python and using correlation to find out similar movies to a particular movie of user's choice.It displays movie items similar to user's choice.
Recommder Systems are of two types : Collabrative filtering and Content-based filtering.
So let's develop a basic recommendation system using Python's Pandas library and correlation.

The dataset of movies and ratings has been downloaded from Movielens.
